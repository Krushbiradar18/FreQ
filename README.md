
# FreQ â€“ Previous Year Paper Analyzer

**FreQ** is a web-based tool that allows students to upload previous year exam papers in multiple formats (PDF, JPG, PNG, DOCX) and analyzes the frequency of repeated questions using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
It's designed to help students prepare smarter by identifying commonly asked questions.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload past exam papers (PDF, image, DOCX)  
- Extracts questions using OCR and text parsing  
- NLP-powered clustering of similar questions  
- Displays most frequently asked questions  
- Visualizes question frequency using charts  
- Downloadable PDF reports with analysis

## ðŸ§  AI/NLP Integration

- **OCR**: Converts image/PDF content to text using Tesseract  
- **NLP**: Processes and compares questions using tokenization, stemming, and semantic similarity  
- **Frequency Analysis**: Groups similar questions and counts occurrences across uploads

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Python, Flask  
- **Libraries**: Tesseract OCR, spaCy / NLTK, Matplotlib / Chart.js, PyMuPDF  
- **Storage**: Local file handling (can be extended to cloud)
