**FreQ** is a web-based tool that allows students to upload previous year exam papers in multiple formats (PDF, JPG, PNG, DOCX) and analyzes the frequency of repeated questions using Natural Language Processing (NLP).<br>
It's designed to help students prepare smarter by identifying commonly asked questions.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload past exam papers (PDF, image, DOCX)<br>
- Extracts questions using OCR and text parsing<br>
- NLP-powered clustering of similar questions<br>
- Displays most frequently asked questions<br>
- Visualizes question frequency using charts<br>
- Downloadable PDF reports with analysis

## ðŸ§  AI/NLP Integration

- **OCR**: Converts image/PDF content to text using Tesseract<br>
- **NLP**: Processes and compares questions using tokenization, stemming, and semantic similarity<br>
- **Frequency Analysis**: Groups similar questions and counts occurrences across uploads

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>
- **Backend**: Python, Flask<br>
- **Libraries**: Tesseract OCR, spaCy / NLTK, Matplotlib / Chart.js, PyMuPDF<br>
- **Storage**: Local file handling (can be extended to cloud)
