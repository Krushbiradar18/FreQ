
FreQ – Previous Year Paper Analyzer

FreQ is a web-based tool that allows students to upload previous year exam papers in multiple formats (PDF, JPG, PNG, DOCX) and analyzes the frequency of repeated questions using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It’s designed to help students prepare smarter by identifying commonly asked questions.
